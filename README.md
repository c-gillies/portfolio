My test portfolio site

This site allows me to play around with and test new concepts as I learn them. The site was local only until 2025-01-24, so there is no version history, although the site is simple to say the least so there's not much to document as of yet.

Some things I've used on this site:
- Fundamental HTML structure, using comments to break up code into clean sections
- Multiple HTML files with links to move between them
- CSS styling that adapts to screen size using relative units of measurement and media query breakpoints
- A small amount of Javascript to add interactivity via a hamburger menu for smaller screens
